🧬 gbk_to_gff.py

A Python script to convert GenBank (.gbk/.gbff) files into GFF3, preserving essential annotation information and ensuring compatibility with downstream tools such as Panaroo, Roary, Prokka, and various pangenome analysis pipelines.

📌 Overview

The GenBank format is extremely rich in detail but not always convenient for pangenome workflows or annotation pipelines that require the GFF3 format.
This script converts GBK/GBFF files into a standardized GFF3 file while maintaining gene integrity, coordinates, product information, and metadata.

📚 About the GFF3 Format

GFF3 (General Feature Format) is widely used for genome annotation. Each line describes a feature (gene, CDS, tRNA, etc.) using its type, position, strand, and attributes.

This script generates a fully valid GFF3 file including:

##gff-version 3

##sequence-region

Features such as gene, CDS, tRNA, rRNA, etc.

Standard attributes: ID, Name, product, db_xref, Parent, and others

Optional embedded FASTA section

🔢 Installation

The script only depends on Biopython:

pip install biopython


Clone or copy the file gbk2gff.py into your project.

▶️ Usage
Convert a single GBK file to GFF3:
python3 gbk2gff.py input.gbk -o output.gff

Convert multiple GBK files into a single GFF:
python3 gbk2gff.py *.gbk -o merged.gff

Generate GFF with embedded FASTA:
python3 gbk2gff.py input.gbk -o output.gff --fasta

Print GFF directly to the terminal:
python3 gbk2gff.py file.gbk

🧠 Features
✔ Preserves key annotation fields

locus_tag

gene

product

db_xref

note

inference

✔ Consistent IDs

If a GBK entry has no locus_tag, the script automatically generates IDs (gene_1, feat_1, etc.).

✔ Automatic Parent assignment

The script detects feature overlap to infer biological relationships:

CDS → gene

mRNA → gene (when applicable)

✔ Phase calculation (for CDS)

Compatible with downstream tools that require codon phase information.

✔ Full support for CompoundLocation

Correctly handles fragmented genes and multi-exon structures.

✔ Optional embedded FASTA

Adds a ##FASTA block at the end of the GFF3 file.

📜 Example Input (GenBank)
LOCUS       contig0001  2450 bp DNA linear
FEATURES             Location/Qualifiers
     gene            100..900
                     /locus_tag="ABC_001"
     CDS             100..900
                     /product="protein X"

🔄 Equivalent Output in GFF3
contig0001	GenBank	gene	100	900	.	+	.	ID=ABC_001;Name=ABC_001
contig0001	GenBank	CDS	100	900	.	+	0	ID=ABC_001_cds;Parent=ABC_001;product=protein X
